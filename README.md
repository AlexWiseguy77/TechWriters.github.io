# Prague Tech Writers Project

## Welcome to the first GitHub workshop! In this first session, you will get your hands dirty with the basic functions in GitHub.

### Git Definition and Overview

> "Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed,data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows." From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)

> GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Github)
